# Diabetic Retinopathy Classification Mobile App : RetinaNet
**RetinaNet** is an AI-powered mobile application for diabetic retinopathy detection. Built using transfer learning on the MobileNet model, it was trained on the Kaggle diabetic retinopathy classification dataset, achieving a 97% test accuracy. The model, developed with PyTorch, is integrated into a Kotlin-based mobile app that allows users to upload images and instantly determine whether they show signs of diabetic retinopathy or not.
